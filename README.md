# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

I cloned the starter code created in Github repository coding-boot-camp/curly-potato (link to repository: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curly-potato).

I created an object with the array of user input information for employee first name, last name, and salary.

I created a boolean variable for whether the confirm message is true or false for moreEmp. This connects to the while loop, meaning that whenever the moreEmp is true, the prompts will run.

The isNan() function determines whether the user input for salary is a number. If it is not a number, then the value 0 is returned.

I declared a constant reference variable for emp which stores employee information and parses the salary input as a string. This stores the employee information in an array through the push function.

I used employeeArray index values to calculate the average salary and log to the console.

I used the Math.random function multiplied by the length of the array in order to get a random employee and log it to the console.
